# Artifacts to be mindful of in data

### In general, I am not accounting for these. A more rigorous/bespoke analysis might try to handle them by throwing them out (e.g. Feb 2021 blackout) or de-meaning (COVID).

#### A separate task would involve predicting when there's going to be a blackout...extreme events analysis is _hard_ though. 

2021: February 17 5:00am - February 18 10:00am MASSIVE power outage
    --not clear why temp should be missing here unless the airport thermometer has no battery and no statefulness for backup purposes??
    
2017: Hurricane Harvey Aug. 26-28
    Reduced load; Likely due to power outages --> I would've thought there would be MORE load with Houstoners evacuating north out of the path of the storm
    
2020-2021: COVID-19 Pandemic
    Clear drop in load in spring 2020
    Large bump in load winter 2020-21 --> likely not just a colder winter than usual (starts in ~December 2020; not just due to February 2021 cold snap)
    
2017: Wind storms?
    No data Feb 8 from 5-6pm <-- Historical data shows wind with 25mph gusts (no precip, temp in low 60s)
    No data Feb 10 from 11am-2pm <-- Historical data shows wind storm with 30mph gusts (no precip, temp in high 60s)
